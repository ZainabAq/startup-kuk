(Hopefully Helpful) Notes about Submission 5:

run npm install in both folders before you do anything
make sure you’re running npm run watch before you try to load up the node page (it just loads a blank screen if you’re not careful)

Not all pages are going to need user authorization (maybe calendar, favorites,
and profile page? Only things which are private)
   - going to need to figure out if favoriting from the recipe page will require
   being logged in or not
   - this is the thing with Authorization: Bearer where Bearer is a random string

Seems like functions that call emulateServerReturn need to have the xhr thing in
them instead (this is what will allow the client-side server to interact with the
real server)
